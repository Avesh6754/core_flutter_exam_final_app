Code Snippet Example
```dart
Dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class StudentCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final String name;
  final String standard;
  final ImageProvider image;

  const StudentCard({
    Key? key,
    required this.name,
    required this.standard,
    required this.image,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: ListTile(
        leading: CircleAvatar(
          backgroundImage: Â  
 image,
        ),
        title: Text(name),
        subtitle: Text(standard),
        trailing: Row(
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
          children: [
            IconButton(
              icon: const Icon(Icons.edit),
              onPressed: () {
                // Implement edit functionality
              },
            ),
            IconButton(
              icon: const Icon(Icons.delete),
              onPressed: () {
                // Implement delete functionality

            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
